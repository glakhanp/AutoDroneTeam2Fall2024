Answer: <p>The problem tells you that Y = (1/n) \\sum_i X_i is a Gaussian random variable with mean \\mu and variance \\sigma^2 / n, and asks you to write down its probability density function (PDF). There is a standard formula for the PDF of a Gaussian random variable with general mean and variance that can be found in the probability lecture slides. So, you just need to plug in \\mu for the mean and \\sigma^2 / n for the variance in that formula and write it down. Doing this yields the answer you see in the solutions. (There are of course deep reasons why the formula for a Gaussian PDF must be of the form in the slides if you accept certain axioms, but we do not delve into those reasons in this course.)</p><p></p>\", meta={'folders': ['exam'], 'title': 'Practice exam spring 2024 Q5a', 'timestamp': '2024-10-02T00:39:54Z', 'user': '', 'tags': ['exam', 'student'], 'likes': 0, 'views': 118}),\n",

Some questions will be on Python coding (either writing code segments or interpreting output of code), and others will be on data science. You can expect questions covering the following topics:<br /><br /></div><ul><li>Python data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)</li><li>Basic Python operations (e.g., loops, arithmetic, manipulating data structures)</li><li>Functions and higher order functions in Python</li><li>List comprehensions in Python</li><li>Histograms</li><li>Random variables and probability distributions</li><li>Sampling, the law of large numbers, and the central limit theorem</li><li>Hypothesis testing</li></ul><div><b><br />Sample Exams:</b><br />Previous semester exams and their corresponding solutions can be found in the &#34;Exam 1&#34; module within the content tab on Brightspace.<br /><br /><b>What is the format/procedure of the exam?</b><br />You will take this exam on printed paper with a pen/pencil, on an exam packet that we will provide to you. Your completed exam will be scanned and uploaded to Gradescope, which we will use for grading and returning the exams to you. We will be leveraging Purdue’s Instructional Data Processing to have your exams uploaded. As a result, <b>it is critical that you follow the exact template we have provided in the exam packet</b>. This includes (1) writing all of your work on the exact sheet of paper provided for each question, and (2) writing your name and PUID at the top of every page. To facilitate this, the first 5 minutes of the exam will be used solely to fill out your name/ID on each page.<br /><br /><b>What materials am I allowed to bring?</b><br />Computers/tablets/calculators/electronic devices are <b>not allowed</b>, but other than that, the exam is open notes. You may bring hard copies of anything on Brightspace and may bring handwritten notes. You can also bring printed notes, e.g., a printed copy of a notebook you created or a PDF of notes you created. You are also allowed to bring a reference book (such as a Python reference book); however, we discourage this because we expect that looking anything up in a book might waste a lot of your time and negatively affect your overall performance.<br /><br /><b>What is the best way to study for the exam?</b><br />Go through all the lecture notes thoroughly. Then make sure you are comfortable with how to do the homeworks that have been assigned so far. Finally, take the practice exams posted on Brightspace.One suggestion is to create your own summary sheet / crib sheet that summarizes and synthesizes the lecture notes and/or homeworks. Often by creating something rather than merely looking at the notes, you will gain a deeper understanding of the material.<br /><br /><b>Will you take off points for syntax errors?</b><br />If the syntax error is trivial (e.g. missing a colon at the end of an if statement), we will only assess a minor penalty. If the syntax error is significant (e.g., you write a for loop without the “in” keyword or write a C-based for loop instead of Python for loop), we may assess more penalty because this may show a fundamental lack of understanding of the syntax.<br /><br /><b>What if I have a DRC accommodation?</b><br />Please schedule an exam with the DRC Testing Center, and email the instructor for your section if you have any questions. All other details will remain the same.<br /><b>Note: </b>Students have until <b>11:55 PM seven days before an exam</b> to submit a request to the DRC Testing Center.<br /><br /><b>Any other logistics to be aware of?</b><br />There are not assigned seats during the exam, but you should leave one seat between you and the people on either side of you. <b>Please try to arrive 10-15 min early</b> to have enough time to find an appropriate seat.</div>\", meta={'folders': ['exam'], 'title': 'Exam 1: FAQ', 'timestamp': '2024-09-19T03:48:42Z', 'user': 'kskmx82xa2s4ad', 'tags': ['exam', 'instructor-note', 'pin'], 'likes': 3, 'views': 283}),\n",

Answer: It seems you are confused between what random variables are and what their realizations (or values) are. When we are given realizations/values, we calculate the mean by averaging the set of values. However, when we are given random variables with PDFs (or PMFs) rather than their realizations, there are theoretical formulae that determine their means (or expected values). Your instructor would have presented examples, beyond the slides, explaining how to carry out such calculations; they would have discussed both calculating the mean from PDFs, and determining the mean of the sample mean random variable. It is difficult to lay out the definition of expected value, its intuition (which is also needed in this problem), its key properties, and its relation to sampling distributions here, but it would be significantly easier to explain this theory in 10-min in person.

Answer: When the final homework is submitted, your program will likely be put through multiple test scenarios that weren&#39;t in the file, which could ask for anything, even triangle numbers up to 10,000.

      "Going through the histogram section for hw 2 I’ve run into an issue where when calculating the limits of the bin Ill get an extra small decimal attached to itExample: Min_val = -1W =2.2Min_val + W = 1.200000000000000002And as a result 1.2 is included when it should be a part of the next bin.Any tips on how I can prevent this?\n",
      "Generated answer: The issue you're experiencing with an extra small decimal attached to your bin limits is likely due to floating-point precision limitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Python, and most other programming languages, floating-point numbers are represented using a binary format (e.g., 64-bit floats) that can lead to rounding errors or small inaccuracies when performing arithmetic operations. These errors can manifest as extra digits at the end of your output values.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a few ways to mitigate this issue:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Rounding**: You can round your output values to a specific number of decimal places using the `round()` function in Python. For example:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "result = -0.017002803765276044\n",
      "rounded_result = round(result, 6)  # Round to 6 decimal places\n",
      "```\n",
      "2. **Decimal module**: If you need more precise control over floating-point arithmetic, consider using the `decimal` module in Python. This module allows you to specify a desired precision for your calculations.\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "from decimal import Decimal, getcontext\n",
      "\n",
      "getcontext().prec = 12  # Set the precision to 12 decimal places\n",
      "result = Decimal('-0.017002803765276044')\n",
      "rounded_result = result.quantize(Decimal('1e-10'))  # Round to 10 decimal places\n",
      "```\n",
      "3. **Use a higher precision data type**: Some libraries, like NumPy, provide higher precision data types (e.g., `numpy.float128`) that can help reduce the effects of floating-point precision limitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding your question about finding the optimal bin width using the integrated squared error approach, it's indeed possible to use an analytical solution. However, I'd recommend discussing this with a TA or instructor during office hours to clarify any doubts you may have.\n",
      "Expected answer: I am not sure what precision the test cases are in but you probably could get away with solving this problem using the round() function. It takes the value you are rounding and a precision modifier so you can round it out to a large number of decimal points, but for this application, I think you can manage with like 5 or 6 decimal points of precision but floats can technically go to 17(?) or somewhere about. Because all our inputs are in integers for this problem rounding these values in this way shouldn't impact the outcome.\n",

      "EDIT: Never mind. I now notice that the first bin's lower bound is NOT inclusive. I misunderstood.Below is a test case that is posted on the README. I am confused on why hist[0] is 0 and not 1 in this case. So we would end up switching max and min val since min > max.Then for hist[0] that would give us a lower bound of 0 and upper bound of 1 for that bin (since bin width would be 1). And since 0 is in this dataset why is it not counted in the first bin of the histogram?Also if you add up all of the frequencies in each bin you only get 7, but there are 8 valid values. EDIT: Never mind. I now notice that the first bin's lower bound is NOT inclusive. I misunderstood.\n",
      "Generated answer: This text does not provide a mathematical solution but rather clarifies some misunderstandings about how histograms are constructed, especially in regards to bin widths and boundaries, particularly when dealing with discrete data and the method of determining optimal bins that minimize the Integrated Square Error (ISE) for estimation purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Understanding Histogram Construction**: A histogram is determined by splitting the dataset into bins based on their values. The number of bins can vary but typically corresponds to the range of the data when considering a standard bin width. For example, if your data ranges from 0 to 10, and you decide to use a uniform bin width of 1 (which was likely intended based on the edits provided), the histogram would look something like [2   4   5   2  7].\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Bin Width and Inclusivity**: The first bin starting from 0 might seem incorrect if one assumes inclusivity of all values starting at 0. However, the question seems to imply confusion about how bins are initially defined without necessarily starting from the lowest possible value (which is often the case). Bin widths are chosen to minimize ISE, and this can involve adjustments based on observed data distribution, which might not always start counting from an actual minimum but rather from where it makes sense for the given dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Calculating Optimal Bin Width**: The optimal bin width for minimizing Integrated Square Error (ISE) is a topic of optimization. In many cases, especially when dealing with discrete data and visualizations, the standard approach involves dividing the range into equal parts based on the number of bins. However, this doesn't directly explain how to derive \"w\" itself without referencing specific equations or methods from your course materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the information provided:\n",
      "- The first bin is defined starting at 0 for simplicity.\n",
      "- The last bin's width might be due to a typo and should ideally align with other parts of the setup.\n",
      "- Optimal bin width calculation typically involves considering the distribution of data points, which may not directly follow simple division or uniform widths.\n",

      "To clarify on optimizing bin width for ISE minimization:\n",
      "- **Deriving Bin Width via Integrated Square Error (ISE)**: Without referencing specific steps from your course materials, finding an optimal bin width usually involves iterative adjustments based on how the distribution of your data points aligns with different bin sizes.\n",
      "- **Simplified Formula**: If a simplified formula is being sought for \"w\" directly related to ISE minimization, it would typically be derived from the context of your specific course, possibly involving calculus or statistical optimization techniques that balance the trade-off between detail and simplicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Actionable Advice**:\n",
      "1. Review Your Course Materials: This includes looking at slides, textbooks, or any other materials provided for how bin widths are optimized for minimizing ISE in histograms.\n",
      "2. Practice Problems or Examples: Try solving practice problems to get a feel for how bin width adjustments impact the distribution of data points and, consequently, the histogram's appearance.\n",
      "3. Consult with Instructors/TAs: If you're stuck on deriving optimal bin widths directly from ISE minimization formulas, discussing these concepts in more depth with your instructors or teaching assistants can provide clear explanations tailored to your learning pace.\n",

However, it's possible that the issue might be related to how Visual Studio is interpreting your code.\n",
      "\n",
      "One possibility is that Visual Studio is picking up a different version of Python than what you're using in Jupyter Notebook or another environment. Try adding `import numpy as np` and `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` at the top of your file, and see if that resolves the issue. Also, make sure that you're running the correct Python interpreter in Visual Studio.\n",

In NumPy, all floating-point numbers are stored in the `float64` format by default. So, instead of just printing `0.005`, you're actually printing `np.float64(0.005)`. This can be useful for debugging purposes or for people who want to know what data type a variable is.\n",

      "Generated answer: You've added some questions related to GitHub usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address them:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Final step after adding, committing, and pushing:** Yes, that's correct. Once you've completed the Git workflow (added, committed, and pushed your changes), your code is live on GitHub. However, it's essential to note that there are additional steps if you want to share a specific version of your work with others or keep track of multiple versions:\n",
      "\t* If you want to update your repository, make further commits, and push the updated changes.\n",
      "\t* To create a new branch for a specific feature or bug fix, use `git branch` and then `git merge`.\n",
      "\t* For more advanced Git management, consider using GitHub's built-in features like pull requests, branches, and issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Troubleshooting PDF commit:** When working with PDFs in VS Code, you might encounter difficulties due to the file format. Here are some potential solutions:\n",
      "\t* Try saving the PDF as a different format (e.g., `.docx` or `.txt`) before committing it.\n",
      "\t* Use a plugin like `vscode-pdf-viewer` to display and edit PDFs within VS Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Pushing work onto GitHub despite issues:** If you're not facing any problems with GitHub, it's still recommended to push your code to the platform. However, if you encounter issues, consider reaching out to the instructor or teaching assistant for assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Uploading a new PDF final on GitHub:** You can create a new branch for your updated work and commit the changes separately. Here are the steps:\n",
      "\t* Create a new branch: `git checkout -b new-branch-name`\n",
      "\t* Make changes, add, commit, and push the updated changes to the new branch.\n",
      "\t* If you want to update the main branch (e.g., `master`), use `git merge` or `git cherry-pick`.\n",
      "\t* Once updated, push the changes to your GitHub repository.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Submitting on Gradescope vs. GitHub:** It's generally recommended to submit your work on both platforms if required by the instructor. If you're unsure about which platform to use, consult with your instructor for guidance.\n",
      "\n",

      "3. Using external libraries (pandas):\n",
      "According to the provided rule of thumb, if the library requires pip/conda installation (not explicitly included), it's likely not allowed. However, since pandas is a built-in Python library and doesn't require additional installation, using it should be acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me know if you have any further questions!\n",
      "Expected answer: I think the rule of thumb is that you would want to avoid importing any libraries that need to \"pip/conda install\" unless there are clear instructions in the handout.

Your concern seems to be that your VSC updates are reflected in the repository without any issues, so I'll address your main question instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "You're having trouble committing and uploading your finished PDF onto GitHub from within VSC. This is a common issue for many users, especially when working with non-standard file types or extensions like PDFs. Here's what you can try:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Try to open the PDF in an editor that allows commit tracking**: Git uses the \"diff\" algorithm to track changes. Some editors might not work well with this. You could try opening the PDF in a text editor, like Notepad++, TextEdit, or even VSC itself (if it supports editing PDFs).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Use `git add` and `.gitignore` files**: If you can't edit your PDF directly in VSC, there might be an issue with the file type that's causing Git to not track changes properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can try these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Open a terminal within VSC.\n",
      "- Run `git status` to see if any changes are being tracked.\n",
      "- Try running `git add .` (if you're not in an empty directory).\n",
      "- Add your PDF and any other files that should be tracked by Git using `git add filename.pdf`.\n",
      "- Make sure there's a `.gitignore` file in the root of your repository. If it doesn't exist, create one to ignore certain types of files.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Try manual upload from desktop**: Sometimes, uploading the PDF directly from your desktop can help avoid issues with VSC.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Check your GitHub settings and permissions**:\n",
      "\n",
      "    a. Open GitHub.\n",
      "    b. Go to your repository's settings.\n",
      "    c. Check if you have the correct permissions for pushing changes to that repository.\n",
      "\n",
      "If these steps don't work, there might be another issue at play here. Sometimes Git and VSC interact in complex ways, especially with non-standard file types or extensions.\n",
      "Expected answer: Make sure you are committing only to the main branch of your own forked repository. The above message only shows what changes have been made/committed since from only version of the repository. You don't have to Contribute or Sync fork. This message above can be ignored.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. When dealing with floating-point errors, there are a few strategies you could try:\n",
      "    - Use a different data type: Depending on what you're doing, switching from floats to ints or vice versa could eliminate rounding issues.\n",
      "    - Use a more precise library: Some libraries like numpy provide more precise calculations than others.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. If you're still having trouble with problem 2 after fixing the issue in problem 1, there are several things you can try:\n",
      "    - Check your code again for any other potential errors or typos\n",

      "Generated answer: To address your questions about recursion in the \"repeater\" method:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Yes, you are correct that since `ret_fun` is defined within the scope of `repeater`, it has access to all variables defined within `repeater`, including `num_repeats`. This makes `recursion` unnecessary for this specific problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, keep in mind that using recursion can be less efficient than iteration and may not scale well for large inputs. It's a good idea to understand the trade-offs and consider alternative approaches if possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Yes, you are allowed to import functions from modules like `scipy.stats` even if they're not explicitly already imported. The slide mentions that this library is used in the context of these slides, suggesting that it's acceptable behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. It's possible to receive partial credit for an individual test case where one value is incorrect and others match the expected output. This depends on the specific testing framework or policy being used, as well as the logic behind the tested function. Some test cases may award points for only matching parts of their expected output, while others might require a full pass to receive credits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember that the specifics of partial credit policies can vary widely between different assignments and projects, so it's always best to check with your instructor or follow any specific guidelines provided in the assignment.\n",

      "Generated answer: Based on the provided context and questions, here are some possible solutions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Python Version**: To ensure that your programs run correctly in the versions of Python available on the Scholar cluster, you can:\n",
      "\t* Check if your local Python installation is compatible with the cluster's version. You can do this by running `python --version` or `python3 --version`.\n",
      "\t* Update pip using `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`. This ensures that any dependencies installed through pip are up-to-date.\n",
      "2. **Scipy Installation**: If you're experiencing issues installing SciPy, try:\n",
      "\t* Removing the existing installation of SciPy using `pip uninstall scipy` and then reinstalling it using `python3 -mpip install --user scipy`.\n",
      "\t* Checking if CMake is installed correctly by running `python -m pip list`. If CMake is installed through pip, you can remove it using `pip uninstall cmak` and then re-install it.\n",
      "3. **German Ngram Files**: To read the \"ß\" character in your Python program, you have a few options:\n",
      "\t* Use Unicode encoding: Replace the problematic characters with their Unicode equivalents (e.g., \"ß\" becomes \"\\u2233\").\n",
      "\t* Check if your Python version supports the \"ß\" character. If it's Python 3.9.11, this might be the issue. You can try running your program on a different Python version or seek assistance from the TAs during office hours.\n",
      "4. **Printing Answers**: In general, printing answers is recommended to verify their correctness. However, if you're unsure about whether your code prints all answers correctly, you can add print statements to check. For example:\n",
      "\t* Instead of just calculating `std_dev`, do: `print(\"std dev is:\", std_dev)`\n",
      "\t* If you have multiple answers or problems, consider printing each one individually.\n",
