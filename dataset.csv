68,"I'm very confused on how we are supposed to find the mean of the distribution given the function that we are given in question 1.

When we are given realizations/values, we calculate the mean by averaging the set of values. However, when we are given random variables with PDFs (or PMFs) rather than their realizations, there are theoretical formulae that determine their means (or expected values). Your instructor would have presented examples, beyond the slides, explaining how to carry out such calculations; they would have discussed both calculating the mean from PDFs, and determining the mean of the sample mean random variable. It is difficult to lay out the definition of expected value, its intuition (which is also needed in this problem), its key properties, and its relation to sampling distributions here, but it would be significantly easier to explain this theory in 10-min in person. Please do visit instructor or TA office hours to clarify this.","{'folders': ['hw5'], 'title': 'HW5 Q1', 'timestamp': '2024-09-22T22:28:25Z', 'user': '', 'tags': ['hw5', 'student'], 'likes': 0, 'views': 139}"

For example, instead of indexing by doing box[len(box) - 1  - i] as suggested, I just made a copy of the list (i figured I shouldn't mess with the original list unless I'm told I can), and used the .reverse() method to reverse the values in the list.
